## Foreword

This work is totally free to use and comes with a very liberal license. That
being said it did take time, effort and skill on my part to work out how to do
it and to put it together. If you get some use out of this work, and can afford
to, I'd would ask you to show your appreciation for my efforts using the Ko-fi
link above. If nothing else it will make it more likely that I'll continue to
work on the system.

Alternatively you can make a more long term commitment using my Patreon, a link
for which you can find on the right hand side of the page. I'll be providing access
to exclusive offerings to patrons and I currently have an in-progress implementation
of a Foundry VTT system for
[The Black Sword Hack RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/331118/Black-Sword-Hack)
and have plans on expanding my offerings over time. You can access my Patreon page
[here](https://www.patreon.com/toocrows).

Thanks in advance.
