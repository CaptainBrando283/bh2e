## Foreword

This work is totally free to use and comes with a very liberal license. That
being said it did take time, effort and skill on my part to work out how to do
it and to put it together. If you get some use out of this work, and can afford
to, I'd would ask you to show your appreciation for my efforts using the Ko-fi
link above. If nothing else it will make it more likely that I'll continue to
work on the system.

I also offer ongoing membership options on Ko-fi that provide access to exclusive
FoundryVTT content. These include my implementation for
[The Black Sword Hack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/331118/Black-Sword-Hack)
and [Barbarians Of Lemuria (Mythic Edition)](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/144526/Barbarians-of-Lemuria-Mythic-Edition)
systems. This content is not available through any other channel at this time
and you can go [here](https://ko-fi.com/peterwood/tiers) to get access to it.

Thanks in advance.
